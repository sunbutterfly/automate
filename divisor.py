###Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.
###(If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number.
###For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)


userNum = int(input('please enter a number:'))

def numDivisor(num):
    numList = []
    for num in numList:
        if userNum % num == 0:
            newNum = userNum

            numList.append(num)




print(numDivisor(userNum))
